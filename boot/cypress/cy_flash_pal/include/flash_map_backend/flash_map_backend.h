 * 1. This system map could be in a file within filesystem (Initializer
 * must know/figure out where the filesystem is at).
 * 2. Map could be at fixed location for project (compiled to code)
 * 3. Map could be at specific place in flash (put in place at mfg time).
 *
 * Note that the map you use must be valid for BSP it's for,
 * match the linker scripts when platform executes from flash,
 * and match the target offset specified in download script.
